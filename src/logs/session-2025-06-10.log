INPUT: a person walking at the beach, "hot AI Summer"

OUTPUT: Here is an enhanced prompt for your video idea using the 10-category framework:

Scene Description:
A young woman with long blonde hair walks alone on a sunny beach, contemplating the phrase "Hot AI Summer" and how AI might impact society.

Visual Style:
Cinematic, realistic style similar to a TV drama. Camera movement should be smooth and fluid.

Camera Movement: 
The camera slowly tracks the woman from behind as she walks down the beach, then transitions to a close-up tracking shot from the front, matching her speed.

Main Subject:
A woman in her mid-20s with long, windswept blonde hair, wearing a flowing white summer dress, walks barefoot in the sand with the ocean to her right.

Background Setting:  
Open, empty beach with the sun starting to set over the ocean horizon, casting a warm orange glow. The sand is a light beige and the water is a deep blue-green. Seagulls fly distantly. 

Lighting/Mood:
Golden hour lighting creates a pensive, contemplative mood. The sun's glare filters through the woman's blowing hair.

Audio Cue:
Gentle ocean waves and a light breeze ambiance that builds in volume as we near the woman. Somber piano music plays softly underneath.

Color Palette:
Warm golden tones, teal ocean blues, pops of white from the dress.

Subtitles & Language:
No subtitles or foreign languages.

Key Improvements:
- Added specific physical details about the woman
- Incorporated cinematic camera movement tracking her walk
- Set a vivid beach scene with colors and sounds  
- Established pensive mood through lighting and audio

INPUT: a person walking at the beach, "hot AI Summer"

OUTPUT: ## Analysis
Your basic concept has a clear subject and setting but needs significant enhancement across all 10 categories to create a compelling VEO3 prompt. The "hot AI Summer" theme offers exciting creative possibilities for visual style and narrative depth.

## Enhanced VEO3 Prompt

A cinematic tracking shot follows a confident young woman in flowing white linen clothing as she walks barefoot along a pristine sandy beach at golden hour. The camera moves parallel to her path, maintaining a medium shot that captures her relaxed stride and the gentle ocean breeze moving through her hair. She wears sleek, minimalist AR glasses that occasionally display subtle holographic data overlays floating in the air around her - weather patterns, tide information, and geometric AI-generated art that seems to dance with the ocean waves. The setting sun casts warm, golden light across the endless stretch of white sand, with turquoise waves gently lapping at the shore. Palm trees sway rhythmically in the background, their fronds creating natural shadows on the sand. The lighting creates a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere with soft rim lighting around her silhouette and gentle lens flares from the setting sun. The audio features upbeat, ambient electronic music with tropical undertones, accompanied by the soothing sounds of waves washing ashore and distant seabirls. The color palette emphasizes warm golden hour tones, soft whites, and vibrant turquoise blues. As she pauses to look out at the horizon, she says with a smile, "This is what the future feels like - where technology and nature dance together." No subtitles.

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Subject Specificity**: Transformed "a person" into "confident young woman" with detailed clothing and tech accessories
2. **Camera Work**: Added professional tracking shot with specific framing
3. **"Hot AI Summer" Integration**: Incorporated AR glasses with holographic displays to blend technology with beach setting
4. **Visual Style**: Established cinematic, ethereal aesthetic perfect for the theme
5. **Lighting Details**: Specified golden hour timing with rim lighting and lens flares
6. **Audio Layers**: Combined electronic music with natural beach sounds
7. **Dialogue Addition**: Added meaningful line that reinforces the AI/nature fusion theme
8. **Color Palette**: Defined warm, inviting tones that support the "hot summer" concept

## Technical Notes

- The AR glasses provide a subtle way to incorporate AI elements without being heavy-handed
- Golden hour timing ensures warm, flattering lighting that supports the "hot summer" vibe
- Tracking shot creates dynamic movement while maintaining focus on the subject
- The holographic overlays can showcase VEO3's ability to blend realistic and digital elements

## Optional Variations to Explore

**Futuristic Approach**: Replace AR glasses with more obvious AI elements like floating screens or robotic companions

**Retro-Future Style**: Add synthwave aesthetics with neon colors and vintage sci-fi elements

**Documentary Style**: Use handheld camera work and natural lighting for a more authentic feel

**Fantasy Direction**: Include AI-generated creatures or impossible beach landscapes that blend reality with digital art

The enhanced prompt now covers all 10 categories while maintaining the core beach walking concept and creatively interpreting "hot AI Summer" as a fusion of technology and natural beauty.
