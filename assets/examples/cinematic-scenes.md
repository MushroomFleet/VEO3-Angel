## Dramatic Scenes

### Monastery Scene
**Prompt:** An aerial shot swoops down through misty mountain peaks toward a hidden monastery perched on a cliff edge. A lone monk in orange robes tends to a small garden of cherry blossoms. The monk looks up at approaching storm clouds and whispers, "This storm will test our resolve, but we shall remain steadfast like these ancient stones."

### Office Elevator Scene
**Prompt:** A very crowded office elevator during morning rush hour. The doors are closed at the start of the video, and as they begin to slowly open, we hear soft elevator music from the ceiling speakers and a gentle mechanical hum. The camera holds a single, continuous, eye-level shot, focused tightly on two well-dressed colleagues standing face-to-face — uncomfortably close due to the packed space. Just as the elevator doors are halfway open, the man calmly and confidently says: "I once sneezed in the all-hands and clicked 'share screen' at the same time. No survivors." The woman reacts with genuine laughter — amused but never exaggerated — and she never speaks, recoils, touches her face, or steps back. Around them, the other elevator passengers remain relaxed and detached: one scrolls on their phone, another stares forward in thought, someone else shifts their bag — but no one looks at or reacts to the main characters. The doors continue to open fully, and at the end of the shot, the two colleagues step out of the elevator while the camera stays fixed in place. The characters never look into the camera. Do not include any captions, subtitles, or on-screen text.

### Woman with Alligator
**Prompt:** A cinematic scene set at night: a glamorous woman with an afro hairstyle and gold jewellery shares a luxurious outdoor pool with a calm alligator. The pool area is surrounded by classical statues and large blue ceramic vases, all dimly lit. The camera starts at water level and slowly zooms in on the woman's face as she makes intense eye contact with the camera. The lighting is moody and soft, with candlelight reflections on the water and a subtle fill light on her face. The audio features slow ambient electronic music, with occasional water ripple sounds. The color palette includes deep slate gray, ocean blue, and warm gold tones. The woman says, "I'm not afraid of anything… except Sundays without drama." No subtitles.

## Progressive Refinement Examples

### Man on Phone - Basic
**Prompt:** The camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat that's making a call on a rotary-style wall phone with a green neon light and a movie scene.

### Man on Phone - Detailed
**Prompt:** A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call. The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.

### Man on Phone - Highly Detailed
**Prompt:** A video with smooth motion that dollies in on a desperate man in a green trench coat, using a vintage rotary phone against a wall bathed in an eerie green neon glow. The camera starts from a medium distance, slowly moving closer to the man's face, revealing his frantic expression and the sweat on his brow as he urgently dials the phone. The focus is on the man's hands, his fingers fumbling with the dial as he desperately tries to connect. The green neon light casts long shadows on the wall, adding to the tense atmosphere. The scene is framed to emphasize the isolation and desperation of the man, highlighting the stark contrast between the vibrant glow of the neon and the man's grim determination.
